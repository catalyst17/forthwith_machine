## Description
Forthwith_machine is a Forth interpreter, written as a part of the coursework by @sayon and based on his [forthress](https://github.com/sayon/forthress). It is written in NASM using bootstrap technique. Main (outer) interpreter is written in Forthress `(fortheart/outer_interpreter.inc)`, while the inner one `(fortheart/forthwith_machine.asm)` and some words are written in assembly.
